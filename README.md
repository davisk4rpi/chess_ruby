# chess_ruby

Ruby version 2.3.0
The Odin Project's Command Line Chess built with Ruby (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project)

This project was the final test of my abilities as a rubiest. In the code, you will find examples of 
- Object Oriented Programing
- Modularize Code
- Test-Driven Development with Rspec
- Complex relationships between methods
- Class inheritence
- Command line gui design

To try it out, make sure you have the correct version of Ruby installed. Then cd into the correct directory and run chess_game.rb in the terminal.
